<h1>Capstone Project : Tetris Game</h1>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is a game that emulates the original tetris game.</li>
  <li>We made this project completely out of C and also used some 3rd party libraries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This project has all the mechanics of the tetris game</li>
  <li>It does not run the game on a terminal , instead runs it on a separate GUI with appropriate sound effects using SDL library.</li>
  <li>It also has a additional pause feature unlike the original game.</li>
  <li>It also has a level system and keeps track of the score in a particular run.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Improvements: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>We can update the GUI to be better looking.</li>
  <li>We can improve the sound quality of the sound effects.</li>
  <li>We can store the highscores of different players in a file to keep track of current score and high score</li>
</ul>
